	* Seperate parsing and looking for allowed
	values a bit more. Some more things can
	be ignored with --ignore now.

	* Made updates using --force with failing parts
	more graceful

	* Make aptmethods less verbose

2005-01-07  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Changed the meaning of the "Architectures:"
	field in conf/distributions. Now a distribution
	will have sources exactly when a "source" is in
	this line.

2005-01-05  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Only generate Release (and Release.gpg) files when
	  something changed.

	* Add a --nolistsdownload option to avoid update and
	  checkupdate downloading all those lists again.

	* Several code clean-ups, should not change anything....

	* Tidy up (introduce bool_t and replace dpkgversion_isNewer)

	* add a magic rule minus ("-") to mark all packages to be
	  deleted.

	* add a checkupdate command to show what would be done.

2004-12-24  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Fixed a boolean inversion in the check if | is allowed
	  in formulas.

	* added FilterFormula to docs/reprepro.1

2004-12-19  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* change parsing of conf/distributions, the fields only
	  copied to Release files can be omitted now. Additional
	  it warns if required fields are missing intead of
	  silently ignoring this block...

	* remove now tells which packages were removed (with -v)
	  and which could not be deleted. Indicies will only
	  be exported when something was deleted.

2004-12-18  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* Modify remove to allow -T to specify the
	  type (deb,dsc,udeb) to delete from.
