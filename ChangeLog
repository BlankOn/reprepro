2005-03-28  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Implement "interatedupdate" command, which iterates the

	DebIndices UDebIndices and DscIndices Options.

	* add another test-case
	* FIX the overflow bug in chunks_replacefield

	* add DebIndices UDebIndices and DscIndices
	  options for conf/distributions. This allows

2005-01-26  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* change FilterList to need a defaultaction given

	* tidy up upgradelist.c and report errors properly

	* Make -T work everywhere -A works.
	* rename variables from suffix to packagetype

	  things to work...

	* fix bug that prevented Release regeneration
	when a index-file is changed to zero entries.

2005-01-19  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* now also include, includedeb, includedsc
	and update will remove files which are no
	longer needed due to newer versions available,
	except when --keepunreferencedfiles is given.

	* change some verbosities of files and refereces

2005-01-17  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* remove short options -e -N -l -r -M -d -D -c -p -o
	to make it more guessable (and reserving short options
	for important and likely often called functions).

	* add --keepunreferencedfile option (if you think
	this is long, remember GNU getopt_long will accept 
	--keep, too)

2005-01-15  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* Only generate Release (and Release.gpg) files when
	  something changed.

2004-12-19  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	  it warns if required fields are missing intead of
	  silently ignoring this block...

2004-12-18  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* remove now tells which packages were removed (with -v)
	  and which could not be deleted. Indicies will only
	  be exported when something was deleted.

2004-12-18  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* Modify remove to allow -T to specify the
	  type (deb,dsc,udeb) to delete from.
