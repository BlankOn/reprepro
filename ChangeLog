	all updated distributions, which will not be needed any more.

2005-02-01  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Add some missing files in Makefile.am so they end up in dist

	warnings on sarge/i386

	* Tell about -b if conf/distributions cannot be found

	* Tell which release.gpg file is missing the signature.

	* Some tidy up to reduce number of warnings with -W

	* Allow multiple keys specified in update's ReleaseCheck

2005-01-29  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Be more descriptive with missing signatures.

	* write recovery HOWTO how to deal with database corruptions

2005-01-27(at least GMT)  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add a lockfile 

2005-01-26  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* change FilterList to need a defaultaction given

	* tidy up upgradelist.c and report errors properly

	* ListHook is also called when --nolistsdownload is given

	* update/checkupdate only download lists not already here

	* Add ListHook keyword for external processing
	  of the downloaded index file before updating.

	* Add FilterList keyword for a list in the
	format of dpkg --get-selections

2005-01-24  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Make includedeb work again.

	* Fix bugs in override file parsing

	* add a listfilter command
	* fix bug in term evaluation with non-existing fields
	* fix another parsing bug when too few spaces where around
	* implement T_NEGATED flag of parsing
	* document listfilter command

	* check conf/distributions conf/updates for unknown fields
	  (to rule out typos, lines with # are ignored)

2005-01-22  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Make -T work everywhere -A works.
	* rename variables from suffix to packagetype

	* allow colons in .changes filenames.
	  (epoch with colon is stripped, but
	   colons after that are allowed)

	* Add tests/test.sh to test for basic
	  things to work...

	* fix bug that prevented Release regeneration
	when a index-file is changed to zero entries.

2005-01-19  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* now also include, includedeb, includedsc
	and update will remove files which are no
	longer needed due to newer versions available,
	except when --keepunreferencedfiles is given.

	* change some verbosities of files and refereces

2005-01-17  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* remove short options -e -N -l -r -M -d -D -c -p -o
	to make it more guessable (and reserving short options
	for important and likely often called functions).

	* add --keepunreferencedfile option (if you think
	this is long, remember GNU getopt_long will accept 
	--keep, too)

2005-01-15  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Seperate parsing and looking for allowed
	values a bit more. Some more things can
	be ignored with --ignore now.

	not referenced by any other package.

	this line.

2005-01-05  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Only generate Release (and Release.gpg) files when

	  it warns if required fields are missing intead of
	  silently ignoring this block...

2004-12-18  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* remove now tells which packages were removed (with -v)
	  and which could not be deleted. Indicies will only
	  be exported when something was deleted.
