TODO:
	do not put/leave files in pool when include gets an older version than already there
	write more automated test-cases
	 (not even run in the testcase yet: reoverride, ... (probably many))
	finish import from incoming dir, implement sending mails to uploader
	extend FilterFormula, FilterList et al to specify type/architecture/component
	switch to only include if source is present
	action to redownload missing pool/ files from some update-rules (looking for md5sum)
	check for harmful override entries (Package, Source, ....)
	also support .bz2 Index file download
	also support pdiff download when mirroring

half far goals:
	handle components, architectures and types as numeric atoms for filters
	rewrite error handling, caching error messages and handling Ctrl-C better.

far goals:
	check for source of package,
	      for sources without packages.
	      for unmeet Dependencies
	      for unmeet Build-dependencies.
	switch to only include a package if no binaries from an older
		source of this package would be left.
	write dokumentation, some examples
	allow multiple versions in a distribution (needs major rewrite I fear)
	option to keep apt-get'able source to each binary (needs mutliple source versions)
