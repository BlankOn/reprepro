TODO:
	auto-remove files no longer needed after package upgrade
		- and think of a concept when to exactly do this
	check values from conf/distributions for sane values
	add override-support while updating (or decide if this should be done)
	implement extractcontrol.c properly
	add support to specify the key used for signing
		(allow it needing a passphrase)
	implement filters for including only specific packages
	allow to specify a keyring to use.
	moving files between distributions
	- only those with source in given thing...
	switch to only include if source is present

	write dokumentation, some examples
	update for use with newer gpgpme

far goals:
	check for source of package, 
	      for sources without packages.
	      for unmeet Dependencies
	      for unmeet Build-dependencies.
