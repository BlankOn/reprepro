TODO:
	check values from conf/distributions for sane values
	check if conf/ chunks contain only allowed values...
	add override-support while updating (or decide if this should be done)
	implement extractcontrol.c properly
	add support to specify the key used for signing
		(allow it needing a passphrase)
	implement filters for including only specific packages
	allow to specify a keyring to use.
	moving files between distributions
	- only those with source in given thing...
	switch to only include if source is present

	write dokumentation, some examples
