TODO: write this file

First if all, this is version 0.0. Thus many things I consider important are still
not implemented. While I'm in 0.0 I'll also change semantics, names and commandline
syntax and even structure of the database without any upgrade path. 

Some naming conventions:
	basename: the name of a file without any directory information.
	filekey: the position relative to the mirrordir. (as found as "Filename:" in Packages.gz)
	full filename: the position relative to /

	architecture: The term like "sparc","i386","mips",...
	component: Things like "main" "non-free" "contrib" ...
