* First if all, this is version 0.0. Thus many things I consider important are still
not implemented. While I'm in 0.0 I'll also change semantics, names and commandline
syntax and even structure of the database without any upgrade path. 

See the file TODO for things I plan to do.

* What it is:

	This project aims to be a weightleight manager of a debian package
	(i.e. binary .deb and source .dsc+.tar.gz+.diff.gz) repository.
	Emphasis is put on having all packages in the pool/-directory,
	generation of signed Release file and maximal checking of all
	sources.
	Libraries needed are libdb3 and libz.
	
* Current status:
	
	Package managment and database mostly works. Missing/To be Finished
	is the direct inclusion of Packages and updating the packages from
	some upstream repository(e.g. debian mirrors).
	Both already works with some Makefile-magic, is meant to be supported
	natively.
	
* Some naming conventions:
	basename: the name of a file without any directory information.
	filekey: the position relative to the mirrordir. (as found as "Filename:" in Packages.gz)
	full filename: the position relative to /

	architecture: The term like "sparc","i386","mips",...
	component: Things like "main" "non-free" "contrib" ...
