Description: Debian package repository producer
 reprepro is a tool to manage a repository of Debian packages
 (.deb, .udeb, .dsc, ...). It stores files either being
 injected manually or downloaded from some other repository
 (partially) mirrored into one pool/ hierarchy.
 Managed packages and files are stored in a Berkeley DB,
 so no database server is needed.
 Checking signatures of mirrored repositories and creating
 signatures of the generated Package indices is supported.
 .
 This package also contains the changestool and rredtool helpers.
