Updates since 0.7:
- unless the new --keepdirectories option is given,
  try to remove pool/ directories that got empty by 
  removing things from them. (To be exact, try to rmdir(2) 
  them every time, which will only work if they are empty).
- Unless the new --noskipold is used, only targets with newly 
  downloaded index files are updated. (new = downloaded
  by the instance of reprepro currently running)
- The default was changed to generate uncompressed sources/Source
  index files. That is the easiest way to get their md5sum into
  the Release file, which newer apt versions are needing. This
  may change back in future versions. (Take a look at the DscIndices
  option on how to specify what to generate)

Updates since 0.6:
- new --ignore=missingfield,brokenold,brokenversioncmp, 
	unusedarch,surpisingarch
- Fix segfault when update file is empty.
	  (Thanks to Gianluigi Tiesi for noticing this.)
- improve manpage a little bit
- many little tidy ups

Updates since 0.5:
- no longer set execute bit of generated Release.gpg files
- use REPREPRO_BASE_DIR for default basedir, parse conf/options
  for further default options. (and add --no options to disable
  boolean options again, same for ignore)
- new command createsymlinks (for symlinks like "stable"->"sarge")
- parse FilterList default action correctly
- putting .changes in a distribution not listed is now an error
  without --ignore=wrongdistribution (and without
  "ignore wrongdistributions" in conf/options)

Updates since 0.4:
- starts of source package tracking
- add quick&dirty --ask-passphrase option
- SignWith's argument is now used, use "yes" or "default" to get old behaviour
- allow ~ in versions listed in .changes files

Updates since 0.3:
- minor bugfix: no longer readd existing packages, when after a delete rule
  a old package was found first.
- adopt short-howto to changes in keywords.
- many tidy ups and little bugfixes
- add Fallback option to specify another host to get mirrored files from
- default basedir is now "." i.e. the current directory.

Updates since 0.2:
- Override: SourceOverride: replaced by (Deb|UDeb|Dsc)Override
- new command reoverride to reapply override information.
- sometimes be a bit more verbose
- new experimental iteratedupdate command , which is a variant of 
  update but needs less memory.
- to ignore Release signature failures two --force's are needed now.

Updates since 0.1.1:
- _md5sums command got removed. New command to dump
  the contents of the files database is _listmd5sums
- --basedir (alias -b) will no longer override prior
  given values to --confdir, --listdir, ....
- fix nasty overflow bug
- write Release, Packages, and Sources files first
  to .new variants and move then all at once.
- new Options DebIndices DscIndices UDebIndices
