This is version 0.1.1, a little update to 0.1 to
fix --includeonlysigned to not accept files signed
with a unknown key or with multiple keys. Note
that this only checks if a key is in the keyring anyway
and your gpg config might automatically download missing
keys. Also note that include and includedsc are mostly
thought for manual inclusion of trusted files. Future
version will have a command to scan some incoming dir
and have some more fine-tuned checks.
