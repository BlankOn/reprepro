  * error messages now with line numbers
  * native support of comments (i.e. lines starting with # are now ignored,
    instead of treated as ignored headers)
  * better support of tabs

Updates since 2.2.3:
- [SECURITY] fix bug causing a Release.gpg with only
  unknown signatures considered as properly signed.

Updates since 2.2.2:
- add support for binNMUs (i.e. .changes files having a Version: that is not
  the source version).
- add zsh auto-completions script

Updates since 2.2.1:
- processincoming can be limited to a single .changes file
- fix to support apt-methods stating Send-Config: false
- set GPG_TTY when stdin is a terminal to ease usage of pinentry-curses

Updates since 2.2.0:
- fix mixup of the name of the --spacecheck option
- fix missing options in bash completions
- fix segfault when including changes without notificators

Updates since 2.1.0:
- renamed cleartracks in removealltracks
- new notifier type for accepted changes files
- bugs fixed:
  * not tidy tracking dependencies on package remove
  * forgot to call some slow notifiers in processincomming
- new --wait-for-lock option
- check free space on update (new --spaceheck option to switch this off)
- extended the changestool helper (add, adddsc, addrawfile, setdistribution)
- processincoming changes:
  * reports and error if a package is not included due to an already existing
    newer version.
  * allow ignoring of unused files and newer versions (Permit:)
  * option when to delete rejected or faulty package (Cleanup:)
- include command names incldued .changes files like processincoming does

Updates since 2.0.0:
- add --silent option
- change some status output to stdout instead of stderr.
- fix some uncessary exporting of index files
- fix bug in term parsing (for FilterFormula and the like)
- add Log: mechanism to log to file and execute external helpers
- example-script to generate a packages.debian.org/changelogs like
  hierachy with changelog and copyright files.

Updates since 1.3.1:
- add "adddeb" action to changestool
- fix bug in manpage ("accept" should have been "allow" for uploaders)
- new AlsoAcceptFor:-header for conf/distributions to allow more fine
  controled which distributions to allow than just codename/suite
  or everything (via --ignore=wrongdistribution)
- fail cleanly when getting a .dsc without Format header
- fix bug in non-libarchive filelist extraction on large lists
- add processincoming command to scan an incoming directory and add
  packages from there. (this needed some refactorisations of other
  code, so beware)
- add gensnapshot command

Updates since 1.3.0:
- bugfix in changestool updatechecksums

Updates since 1.2.0:
- now uses libgpgme11 instead of libgpgme6.
- remove --onlyacceptsigned switch (soon to be be replaced by something
    useable, hopefully)
- only reject a package because of signatures if it only has bad signatures
  and no good one. (Rejecting a package because of a missing key when
  it would have processed without signature did not really make sense)
- new --ignore=brokensignatures to also accept packages with broken signatures
  without any valid signature.
- Now looks at the Binary: and Version: fields of a .changes file.
  Unless the new --ignore=wrongversion is specified, a dsc must
  have the same version, and a .deb must have this source version
  unless --ignore=wrongsourceversion is given. A .deb must also
  contain a package listed in the Binary: header unless 
  --ignore=surprisingbinary is given. (A .dsc with an other name
  or a .deb with an other Source than the Source-header if the
  .changes file is still not ignoreable due to file naming issues)
- FilterList in update and pull rules now has a space separated list
  of filenames instead of only a single filename.
- new Uploaders field in conf/distributions:
  allows to specify what a .changes file has to be signed with to be allowed in
- new helper program "changestool" to preprocess .changes files.

Updates since 1.1.0:
- improve message of missing files
- checkin now support .tar.bz2, .diff.bz2 and .tar.bz2
  (checkindsc did not care, binaries may contain tar.bz2 if reprepro
   is compiled with libarchive and libbz2)
- fix bug delaying full Contents- generation

Updates since 1.0.2:
- extended the (experimental) package tracking feature
- cleartracks removes files losing their last reference (unless --keepunreferenced as usual)
- fix bug of not generating a uncompressed Sources line in Release when no uncompressed
  Sources file is generated.

Updates since 1.0.1:
- fix segfault in non-libarchive code introduced with 1.0.0

Updates since 1.0.0:
- add clearvanished command
- cope with GNU ar style .deb files (when using libarchive)
- cope with strange control.tar.gz files (when not using libarchive)

Updates since 0.9.1:
- reject some .changes earlier, delete added files
  when checks after copying files to the pool failed.
- handle some signals (TERM, ABRT, INT and QUIT) a bit
  more gracefully
- some little fixes in the documentation
- add predelete action to delete packages that would be
  deleted or replaced in an update
- add new copy command to copy a single package from
  one distribution to another.

Updates since 0.9.0:
- fix bug in post-export script handling.
- fixed documentation in tiffany.example how to generate
  .diff directories the new apt can read.

Updates since 0.8.2:
- added --export= option and harmonized exporting of
  distributions. (Now every distribution processed
  without errors is exported by default, with options
  for always, never or only export it when changed)
- added pull and checkpull actions.
  Those are roughly equivalent to upgrade rules with
  file:/path/to/basedir Method, but faster and a bit
  more limited (files cannot change components)
- fix segfault of checkupdate
- fix including a changes file with source and restricting
  to some binary distribution or to binary package type.
- add support to use libarchive instead of calling ar and tar
- added Contents file generation support
- now supporting libdb-4.4, libdb-4.3 and libdb3

Updates since 0.8.1:
- mark process list files and only skip those not marked
  as processed instead those not newly downloaded.
- change the wording of some warnings, add some new
- new WORKAROUND part in the manpage
- add example bash_completion script

Updates since 0.8:
- some bugfixes (segfault, memmory leak, manpage typos)
- enforcement of extensions of include{,dsc,deb,udeb} files
  to .changes,.dsc,.deb,.udeb and new --ignore=extension to
  circumvent it.
- support generation of the NotAutomatic field.
- added --ignore=missingfile to ignore files missing in 
  a .changes file, but lying around and requested by
  a .dsc file.

Updates since 0.7:
- unless the new --keepdirectories option is given,
  try to remove pool/ directories that got empty by 
  removing things from them. (To be exact, try to rmdir(2) 
  them every time, which will only work if they are empty).
- Unless the new --noskipold is used, only targets with newly 
  downloaded index files are updated. (new = downloaded
  by the instance of reprepro currently running)
- reprepro now always puts the checksums of the uncompressed
  index files into the Release file, even if it is not
  written to disk. This fixes some problems with newer
  versions of apt. (Take a look at DscIndices to get older
  versions of reprepro to please them, too).
- The export hooks (the programs specified as DebIndices,
  UDebIndices and DscIndices) are now always called once
  with the uncompressed names.
- to compile reprepro with woody without a backported zlib
  use the -DOLDZLIB switch.
- reprepro now supports bzip2 output natively. (You can
  still use the example if you want to call bzip2 yourself
  instead of using the libbz2 library)
- new db/release.cache.db file storing md5sums of written
  index and Release files there. (This can cause Release
  file give old md5sums when the files are not what it
  expects, but unless you manually changed them that is
  a good way to find errors, and manually changing if
  fragile anyway, so better do not do it but ask me
  if some feature is missing overrides cannot offer yet).

Updates since 0.6:
- new --ignore=missingfield,brokenold,brokenversioncmp, 
	unusedarch,surpisingarch
- Fix segfault when update file is empty.
	  (Thanks to Gianluigi Tiesi for noticing this.)
- improve manpage a little bit
- many little tidy ups

Updates since 0.5:
- no longer set execute bit of generated Release.gpg files
- use REPREPRO_BASE_DIR for default basedir, parse conf/options
  for further default options. (and add --no options to disable
  boolean options again, same for ignore)
- new command createsymlinks (for symlinks like "stable"->"sarge")
- parse FilterList default action correctly
- putting .changes in a distribution not listed is now an error
  without --ignore=wrongdistribution (and without
  "ignore wrongdistributions" in conf/options)

Updates since 0.4:
- starts of source package tracking
- add quick&dirty --ask-passphrase option
- SignWith's argument is now used, use "yes" or "default" to get old behaviour
- allow ~ in versions listed in .changes files

Updates since 0.3:
- minor bugfix: no longer readd existing packages, when after a delete rule
  a old package was found first.
- adopt short-howto to changes in keywords.
- many tidy ups and little bugfixes
- add Fallback option to specify another host to get mirrored files from
- default basedir is now "." i.e. the current directory.

Updates since 0.2:
- Override: SourceOverride: replaced by (Deb|UDeb|Dsc)Override
- new command reoverride to reapply override information.
- sometimes be a bit more verbose
- new experimental iteratedupdate command , which is a variant of 
  update but needs less memory.
- to ignore Release signature failures two --force's are needed now.

Updates since 0.1.1:
- _md5sums command got removed. New command to dump
  the contents of the files database is _listmd5sums
- --basedir (alias -b) will no longer override prior
  given values to --confdir, --listdir, ....
- fix nasty overflow bug
- write Release, Packages, and Sources files first
  to .new variants and move then all at once.
- new Options DebIndices DscIndices UDebIndices
